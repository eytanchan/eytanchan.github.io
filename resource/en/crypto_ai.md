title: Crypto and AI
---  

Blockchain and AI were completely unfamiliar concepts to me just a few years ago. I first encountered Bitcoin in 2014 in my English homework book. At the time, both my teacher and the media told me it was a **Ponzi scheme**, so I forgot about it. I learned about self-driving technology in 2017 and believed it would become a reality within 10 years. I also learned about NLP (specifically Microsoft’s XiaoIce) in 2017, thinking it was useless, until I read OpenAI’s technical post in 2022 on Science Journal.

Now, huge changes are happening. I’m writing this to record my thoughts and future plans.

**My Crypto Journey** began with I bought my first fractional Bitcoin (worth \$1) in October 2024 at a price of \$50K. Five months later, I saw Bitcoin hit \$100K. I began to wonder: *Maybe it’s not a Ponzi scheme?*

After the [Bybit hack involving \$1.4 billion worth of ETH by North Korea](https://therecord.media/hackers-drained-bybit-crypto-exchange-hack),  
I decided to step into this industry. I had one simple thought: if an exchange involves such massive sums of money (even enough to lose \$1.4B), it must be easy to earn money there.

I haven't lost much money over the past year, perhaps thanks to strict **risk management**. However, I haven't earned much either. Since I knew nothing about the industry, I moved very carefully.

From **meme coins** (on both BSC and Solana) to **Perps** (perpetual futures), **launchpads**, and depositing/trading for **TGE points**, I have tried 90% of what this industry offers, maybe even more.

If someone were to ask me what crypto or Bitcoin is, I would say that crypto is essentially a branch of fintech. From the very beginning of the bitcoin whitepaper, blockchain technology was designed for only one thing: to record transactions.

Anyway, here are my **conclusions on crypto:**

1.   It is easy to make money here, but it is just as easy to lose everything.
2.   With leverage and **zero-cost TGE mechanisms**, this is a total **gambling game**. It is a **zero-sum game**: if you lose, it means someone else wins.
3.   No one can predict the future. Betting to win means you need an **informational edge** or faster execution speed than others at that specific moment. If not, you will lose, and will keep losing until you know something others definitely don't.
4.   The **intrinsic value** of BTC is zero; like gold, it is just a bunch of **atoms** (or in BTC's case, bits). However, for ETH, there are valuation models to estimate its price because it is a business blockchain. But currently, there is no "value investment" here; everyone just wants to get rich quick, dreaming of turning \$10 into \$10M overnight.
5.   **Stablecoins** are the biggest innovation in this industry. They are **reinventing banking**. In principle, the future will be shaped by this technology.
6.   The future of this industry must happen on-chain. Because no one would believe the things that they don't have the ability to verify, it fits **human nature**. If I cannot verify the facts, the best choice is to stay out of the market. That is the principle.
7.   This gambling game, and perhaps the darker side of the industry, will always exist. Some leave, and some enter, recorded by blockchains they ever claimed.

Then comes to the thoughts on AI, especially LLMs (Large Language Models), I am trying to build something really exciting these days.

My main conclusion is that LLM is essentially a **lossy compression** of all human knowledge that could be recorded, whatever the format. Human intelligence operates on the same principle. What I mean is, LLMs will become the biggest **leverage** of this era, perhaps in all of human history.

This year is the "Year of the Agent." **Tool calling** was just invented in the last few months, opening up limitless imagination.

We are witnessing the beginning of the AI decade. The economic impact of AI is arriving faster and faster. 

Whether for better or worse, we will adapt, just as we human have over the past hundred years. I remain positive and optimistic, and I plan to dedicate all my time to diving into this field to create something that brings happiness or revenue.
